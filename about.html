                      Amy loves robots, so she was happy to be working on a team that was cool with having a robot-related POE project. She worked on most of the electrical and software work and leveraged her experience working in the RoboLab to integrate the different pieces of the project. When she wasn’t working on POE, she could most likely be found in the LPB working on the robotic tractor. If she’s not working on a robot, she’s probably sleeping.</p>

Tim provided much of the technical work on designing the shooting mechanism, as well as serving as our resident test dummy for testing the robotics tracking and shooting mechanisms. His learning goals were to improve his technical skills for complex mechanisms and to work on improving his conflict resolution skills. He felt that he was able to both build an effective shooting mechanism and help keep the team functioning well together. His proudest accomplishment for this project is the set of metal legs which he fabricated for the final iteration of the project.</p>

His work consisted largely of the mechanical elements of the turret, such as the frame and shell, as well as the shooting mechanism and mounting plate. Bennett is happy to have met his objectives of strengthening structural and integrated design skills, and was excited for the opportunity to work on aesthetic design as well. His father is very proud of him for finally caving and using his engineering power for evil.</p>

With the help of her team, she started on the mechanical subsystem and realized her passion for design, ideation, and documentation. Towards the beginning of the project, Mia worked on mechanical design and fabrication of the frame and caster holder of the robot, and was able to gain confidence in using CAD. Later in the project, she also worked on logo design and the website.</p>

His work on this project fell primarily to giving our robot a voice, and trying to convey a sense of personality in the way it interacts with our test subjects. In the process of building the software he strengthened his understanding of speech recognition and sentiment analysis techniques as well as improving his code architecture skills. In building the supporting hardware he gained experience in PCB design, precision electrical fabrication techniques, and circuit troubleshooting. Still in progress is uploading a copy of his consciousness to the Intel Euclid.</p>
